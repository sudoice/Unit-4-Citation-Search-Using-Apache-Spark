This code implements a sophisticated citation search system using Apache Spark's machine learning capabilities. It processes a large corpus of research papers, extracting and indexing citation relationships to enable efficient search and retrieval of related papers based on citation data. Utilizing Spark's distributed computing capabilities, the system ensures scalability for handling big datasets. The notebook demonstrates data loading, transformation, and querying using PySpark, showcasing real-world applications of Spark in academic research and data analysis.It's designed to analyze academic citation networks to predict whether paper A will cite paper B based on various features extracted from their metadata.
This system is particularly notable for its use of cross-validation to optimize model hyperparameters and its ability to handle large-scale network data through Spark's distributed computing capabilities. It demonstrates advanced techniques for citation search in citation networks that could be adapted to other network analysis scenarios.
This model predicts whether a citation relationship exists between two academic papers.

Some key use cases for the Citation Search Using Apache Spark project:

1)Academic Research Assistance: Helps researchers find related papers by exploring citation networks, supporting literature reviews and discovering influential works.<br>
2)Citation Network Analysis: Enables data scientists or bibliometric analysts to analyze citation patterns, identify key publications, or visualize the evolution of research fields.<br>
3)Recommendation Systems for Publications: Can be adapted to suggest relevant papers to researchers or students based on citation similarity and topic relevance.<br>
